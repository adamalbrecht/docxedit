Ruby Docx Edit
==============

A very minimal Ruby library that let you edit .docx file in some simple way

* make string replacement in .docx document
* insert new paragraphe using XML before or after a block of text

This is not meant to be fully functional or even completed in the future, take this code if you want at your own risk.



 require 'docxedit'
 doc = DocxEdit::Docx.new('mydocfile.docx')
 doc.contains? /A simple string/ #return true if regexp is match in one of the document xml node
 doc.replace(/str_to_find/, "replacement") #replace the matched string with "replacement" string
 block = doc.find_block_with_content("[[EXACT block content]]") #return a ContentBlock object

 # insert a new block of text before block
 doc.insert(:before, block, ContentBlock.new("<w:p><w:r>A new block for this file.</w:r></w:p>", "A new block for this file."))
